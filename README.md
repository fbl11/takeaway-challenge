Task
-------

Work on this challenge as conclusion of week 2, to work towards these goals:

* I use a methodical approach to solving problems
* I test-drive my code
* I can work to a specification
* I can write standards-compliant, clean object-oriented code

Instructions
-----

* Fork [this repo] (https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge)
* Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```
